Clone https://github.com/Synthlight/Base-Dll-Proxy so it winds up in the same parent dir as this.<br>
e.g.:
```
\Plugin Mods\Base-Dll-Proxy
\Plugin Mods\Neuter-Encryption
```
Then just open and built. This does have pre-set post-build copy commands that will probably fail on your system.

All I've (LordGregory) done is just put them in a plugin to patch the assy on startup.
